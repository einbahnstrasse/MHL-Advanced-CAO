### Deadline: Week 6: {{ site.week-06 }}  
_In one week!_   

### 1. Watch the Video  

_Enable German subtitles if it would help._   

{% include video id="S5BhQiny7O0" provider="youtube" %}    

> "Well there's no reason why the simple shapes of stories can't be fed into computers. They have beautiful shapes. [...] It's the same of the curve that matters and not their origins." —Kurt Vonnegut  

### 2. Study the Patch   

<img src="/MHL-Advanced-CAO/assets/images/vonnegut.patch.v01.png" alt="Vonnegut-patch">   

[Download this boiler patch here.](/MHL-Advanced-CAO/assets/patches/vonnegut.story.shapes.v01.maxpat){:target="_blank"}  

### 3. Create a Small Étude   

* Use the `multislider` object to recreate Kurt Vonnegut's story curves, or make your own.   
* Transform, scale, or re-calculate things based on your curve's points by any means.   
* Recall from our lessons how we generated bach lists of `onsets`, `cents`, `durations`, and `velocities`.  
* Map your data to pitches and rhythms in some way, however you like, and send it to `bach.roll`.  
* Play your sequence using `bach.ezmidiplay`. Make changes and adjust your algorithm to "personalize" it and obtain something you like!    

_Be prepared to share your bach sequence and patch in class in Week 7!_
